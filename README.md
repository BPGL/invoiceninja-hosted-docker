# Docker for [Invoice Ninja](https://www.invoiceninja.com/)

:crown: **Features**

:lock: Automatic HTTPS (:heart: [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/))  
:fire: NGINX webserver support [NGINX](https://nginx.org/)  
:hammer: Fully production-ready through Helm Chart

## Get some Kubernetes + Helm with that!

Introducing our very own [Helm Chart](https://github.com/invoiceninja/dockerfiles/tree/master/charts/invoiceninja) that helps you launch a simple standalone app to a production-ready, highly available Invoice Ninja setup. All you need to do is initialise Kubernetes (available with Docker Desktop), install [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/), and spin up Invoice Ninja using the steps provided [here](https://github.com/invoiceninja/dockerfiles/tree/master/charts/invoiceninja#installing-the-chart).

## Alternatively get started with Docker Compose

The dockerfile has been revamped to make it easier to get started, by default the base image selected is 5 which will pull in the latest v5 stable image.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/invoiceninja/dockerfiles.git
cd dockerfiles
```

Instead of defining our environment variables inside our docker-compose.yml file we now define this in the `env` file, open this file up and insert your `APP_URL`, `APP_KEY` and update the rest of the variables as required.

```
APP_URL=http://in.localhost:8003/
APP_KEY=<insert your generated key in here>
APP_DEBUG=true
REQUIRE_HTTPS=false
IN_USER_EMAIL=
IN_PASSWORD=
```

If `IN_USER_EMAIL` and `IN_PASSWORD` is not set the default user email and password is "admin@example.com" and "changeme!" respectively. You will use this for the initial login, thereafter, you can delete this two environment variables.

The `APP_KEY` can be generated by running

```bash
docker run --rm -it invoiceninja/invoiceninja php artisan key:generate --show
```

Copy the entire string and insert in the env file at `APP_KEY=base64....`

To ensure folder permissions are correct when the container comes up for the first time it is important that you set the correct folder permissions on the `docker` folder.

From the terminal run

```bash
chmod 755 docker/app/public
sudo chown -R 1500:1500 docker/app
```

### Note for people running the container locally on their PC ###

If you are running the container locally, then the container will need to resolve the host, to support this you will want to insert your LAN IP address and the host name in the hosts file located in ```config/hosts```

For example, lets say your APP_URL is ```http://in5.test:8000``` and your LAN IP is 192.168.0.124 the hosts file will have an entry looking like this:


```192.168.0.124 in5.test```

**Please note that for PDF generation using local host, your domain name MUST end in .test for your PDFs to generate correctly, this is a DNS resolver issue with chromium.

All that is left to do now is bring up the container


``` docker-compose up -d```


**Note: When performing the setup, the Database host is ```db```

### Running on ARM64 (Raspberry Pi 4)

When deploying on an ARM64 system, you need to comment out the `image: mysql:8` line and uncomment `image: mariadb:10.4` in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

### Updating the Image when using `docker-compose`

As `docker-compose` does not support any form of version control, this git provide updates to `docker-compose.yml` directly.

To upgrade to a newer release image, please make sure to update the `docker-compose.yml` first by running

```bash
git pull
```

It is recommended to perform a backup before.
You may need to manually merge any changes that cannot be merged automatically by git.

### Thanks
Massive thank you to [lwj5](https://github.com/lwj5) for the tireless work to continually improve the dockerfile and its associated tooling.

# Special Instructions for Hosted Installation

## Purpose if this fork

For hosted, branded installations you have to purchase a special license from Invoice Ninja.  
You can not just get this repository and use ot for free.  
It will also not work technically, because you have to get access to a closed Admin Module.

## How will it work
You will have:
- React UI from [this repo](https://github.com/invoiceninja/ui) under your root domain
- Backend from [Docker version](https://hub.docker.com/r/invoiceninja/invoiceninja/) under all subdomains

## Prerequisites

- Get access to Admin Module repo in GitHub from Invoice Ninja
  - Set up SSH key with which you can access Admin Module Repo on GitHub
- Create CDN setup:
  - Root domain and www subdomain point to your server, to port 8080 (can be customized by adding REACTUI_EXPOSE_PORT entry to `env`)
  - All subdomains except www point to your server, to port 8081 (can be customized by adding API_EXPOSE_PORT entry to `env`)
  - Enable SSL
- Create account in any email service that supports SMTP, add entries to env
- Create account in Twilio, create a verification service there. Add to env API keys and verification app id.


## Setup instructions
- Copy `env-EXAMPLE` to `env`.  
- Edit it according to your environment. Mind slashes in the end of URLs, this is important.
- Customize images in `config/images/`


### Set up React UI
You will most likely want to use another UI repository, because you will want to change branding:
change name of the app, replace logo, use custom list of currencies, etc. Refer to this repo as example:  
https://github.com/invoiceninja/ui/compare/main...BPGL:invoiceninja-ui:main
You can customize what UI repo to use in your installation by updating `REACTUI_REPO` in `env`.

The most important steps are to update .env, and set:
- `VITE_API_URL` to the same value as `APP_URL`
- `VITE_IS_HOSTED=true`
- `VITE_APP_TITLE` to what ever name you want to give your UI

### Helper scripts

The set of scripts that manage the installation, update and rebuild of components. You have to run them under root, 
or under a user that has permissions to execute Docker commands.

- `start.sh` - this will build and launch everything
- `rebuild_app.sh` - this will rebuild the `app` container (the backend). Use to pull updates, etc.
- `docker-create-react-ui.sh` - this will download and rebuild React UI.  
  

The rest of the scripts are called by `start.sh` and perform different phases of setup and customization.
You can edit them according to your needs:

- `docker-localize.sh` - removes excessive currencies and payment types
- `docker-enable-stripe.sh` - enables Stripe module
- `docker-create-admin.sh` - creates admin module, nothing to customize here
- `docker-replace-images.sh` - replaces logo in backend app, nothing to customize here


## Persistent data
The data that needs to be persistent **and regularly backed up**:
- `docker/app/public/storage/`
- `docker/mysql/`

Optional:
- `redis/data/`
